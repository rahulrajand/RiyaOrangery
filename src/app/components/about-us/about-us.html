              <h2>🌿 Our Story — Riya Orangery</h2>
              <p>
                What started with a small cactus on a windowsill slowly turned into something much
                bigger. As a city girl deeply drawn to nature, I found joy in collecting indoor
                plants and succulents. But I also faced the same frustration many plant lovers
                experience — plants struggling, wilting, or failing because they weren’t suited to
                our local climate or soil conditions.
              </p>

              <p>Instead of giving up, I started learning.</p>

              <p>
                I studied how plants grow in their native environments. I experimented with soil
                mixes. I observed how sunlight, airflow, and watering habits affect different
                species. What began as personal curiosity slowly became a small home orangery — a
                space where plants could grow healthy, happy, and stress-free.
              </p>

              <p>And that’s how Riya Orangery was created 🌱</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
              <h2>🌵 Our Focus</h2>
              <p>We specialize in:</p>
              <ul class="about-list">
                <li>Indoor plants</li>
                <li>Succulents</li>
                <li>Cacti</li>
                <li>Carefully crafted soil mixes</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At Riya Orangery, we believe healthy plants begin with the right soil. Especially
                for succulents and cacti, soil is not just dirt — it is the foundation of life.
                Every soil recipe we prepare is made with understanding, patience, and real
                experience.
